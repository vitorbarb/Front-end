    <p>I stay out too late
        Got nothing in my brain <br>
        That's what people say, mm-mm <br>
        That's what people say, mm-mm</p>
    <p>I go on too many dates
        But I can't make 'em stay <br>
         At least that's what people say, mm-mm <br>
         That's what people say, mm-mm</p>
         <p>But I keep cruisin'
            Can't stop, won't stop movin' <br>
            It's like I got this music in my mind <br>
            Sayin' it's gonna be alright</p>
